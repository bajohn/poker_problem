8 straight flush
7 four of kind
6 full house
5 flush
4 straight
3 three of kind
2 two pair
1 pair 




straight flush = 8*1M + 10k*rank of highest (careful with wheel)
four of kind = 7*1M + 10k * rank of four (+kicker)
full house = 6*1M + 10k * rank of three + 100 * rank of pair
flush = 5 * 1M + 10k * rank of highest card in flush
straight = 4 * 1M + 10k * rank of highest card in straight (careful with wheel)
three of kind = 3*1M + 10k*rank of three of kind + 100*(kicker 1) + (kicker 2)
two pair = 2*1M + 10k*rank of higher pair + 100*rank of lower pair + (kicker)
pair = 1M + 10k*rank of pair + 100*( kicker 1) + (kicker 2) + .01 * (kicker 3)

tie breaker:
highest card after used cards

-----
choosing 3 hands:
take 45 choose 6,
then manually go through 15 possible hands from these


------
more efficient- must have either 2 pairs, 3 of kind, or straight
so
need either
card value | value here
2 0.5
4 1.0
5 0.5
6 0.5
7 0.5
8 0.5
9 1.0

from the set of 6, count the number of above cards. total must be at least 3
For example, if the 6 cards are
2H, 4S, 8D, 7S, 10D, JC
 the counted value is 0.5*3 + 1.0 = 2.5 so it's not possible to crack the aces

But
2H, 4S, 8S, 7S, 8D, JC
 the counted value is 0.5*4 + 1.0 = 3.0 so it is possible to crack the aces
 for example 2H 8H; 7S 8S; 4S JC
