6 lows- always works
5 lows, 1 high- always works
4 lows, 2 highs- always works
3 lows, 2 highs, 1 other- if O is next to L, doesn't work- so take O- 3/5 chance its neighbor is L, so 2/5 works
2 lows, 2 highs, 2 other- 1/5 chance that L is next to L AND H/H are split and this works

LL HO HO
LL HH OO
LH HO LO
LH LH OO
LO HH LO

A OR B
((15/45)(14/44) + 8/45)

 C OR D
 C(A) + C(B) + D(A) + D(B)
 ( ((rel A)*(13/43*12/42) + (1-rel A)*(15/45*14/44)) + ((rel A)(8/45)
